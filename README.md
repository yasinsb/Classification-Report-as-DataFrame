# Classification Report as DataFrame

A small madule that receives class prediction and true classes of a classification excercise and creates a report in a dataframe format. I created this to avoid directly dealing with the text output created by "classification report" from scikit-learn package. 

## requirements:
#### numpy
#### pandas
#### scikit-learn
